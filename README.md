# MauiFinal

The tasks in the picture are as follows:

## Task description
1. **UX/UI design and functionality:**
   - The focus is exclusively on the design and implementation of UX/UI (user experience and user interface).
   - Only test data will be used (no real database or backend functionality).

2. **Programming with .Net MAUI:**
   - The app must be developed with the **.Net MAUI** framework.

3 **Assessment:**
   - The maximum score is **30 points**.
   - Each task is awarded **5 points**.

4 **Requirements for UX/UI:**
   - The presentation and functionality of the user interface must meet the requirements.
   - Changes should be implemented correctly and appropriately.

5 **GitHub publication:**
   - The app code must be uploaded to a public repository on **GitHub**.

## Aim of the app
The app serves as a course registration application for students:
- Students can log in with their **email** and **password**.
- They have access to their own profile.
- Students can view their current course registrations.
- They can also view past course registrations (e.g. from previous semesters).
- It is possible to search for courses and register new courses for the current semester.
- Courses that have already been registered can be deregistered.

Multilingualism has been added - because language connects -

My solution looks like this

# CourseApp – .NET MAUI Project Documentation

## 📦 Overview

**CourseApp** is a .NET MAUI mobile application that provides a simple course registration flow:
- Login
- View profile
- Register for courses

The project is structured using **MVVM**, **dependency injection**, and includes localization, CI, and unit testing.

```

## 🌍 Localization

Localization is implemented using `.resx` resource files:
- `Strings.en.resx` – English
- `Strings.de.resx` – German
- `Strings.th.resx` – Thai

The app uses `LocalizationResourceManager` to dynamically load translations and applies them via Picker UI.

---

## 🧭 Navigation Flow

- `LoginPage` → `ProfilePage` → `CourseRegistrationPage`
- Navigation is handled through `INavigation` via Dependency Injection

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing

Two example tests are included:
- `LocalizationTests` → Verifies localized string resolution
- `NavigationTests` → Verifies AppShell structure and navigation

Run with:
```bash
dotnet test
```

---

## ☁️ CI with GitHub Actions

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
Builds the project, restores dependencies, runs tests on every push to `main`.

---

## 📱 Technologies

- .NET MAUI
- C# 11
- MVVM Pattern
